        <p className="mb-4 text-black">
        Recent graduate of an AI-driven Software Engineering bootcamp at Skills City. 
        <br/>Earlier I did graduation in engineering, part of my education I built strong foundation on programming and design through learning GW-Basic, HTML, Delphi, AutoCAD, Gerber, Grafis, Investronica, Photoshop. My passion in IT motivated me doing AISE Bootcamp at Skills City to quickly develop my skills to move into this sector.<br/>As a career changer, transitioning into the IT sector, I am coming with a wealth of transferable skills in decision-making, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork, cultivated through my previous career experiences.
I am bringing a fresh perspective and a strong commitment to success in the tech industry.</p>
